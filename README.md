# Sales funnel and A/A/B test analysis

## Project background
This project focuses on understanding user behavior within the mobile application of a food products startup. The primary goal is to analyze the sales funnel to uncover how users progress through the purchasing process. Additionally, the project examines the results of an A/A/B test to inform decisions about potential design changes in the app. Specifically, the test results will guide the design team's final decision regarding font updates.

Key questions include:

    - How many users reach the purchase stage?
    - At which stages do users tend to drop off?
    - Are there specific stages that pose significant barriers?
    - Which set of fonts provide better conversion rates across different stages?
