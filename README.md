# Sales funnel and A/A/B test analysis

## Project background
This project focuses on understanding user behavior within the mobile application of a food products startup. The primary goal is to analyze the sales funnel to uncover how users progress through the purchasing process. Additionally, the project examines the results of an A/A/B test to inform decisions about potential design changes in the app. Specifically, the test results will guide the design team's final decision regarding font updates.

The data for this analysis comes from user activity logs. Each log entry represents a user action or event within the app, providing a detailed view of how users interact with various features and progress through the funnel.  

Key questions include:

- How many users reach the purchase stage?
- At which stages do users tend to drop off?
- Are there specific stages that pose significant barriers?
- Which set of fonts provide better conversion rates across different stages?
